# Secure Password Manager Library üîê

This library provides a secure, password-based key-value storage solution for managing sensitive data like credentials. The `Keychain` class uses AES-GCM encryption to protect stored data, allowing for safe storage, retrieval, and serialization of encrypted information.

## Introduction üí°

The `Keychain` library securely stores credentials using a password-based encryption mechanism. It ensures that only users with the correct password can encrypt or decrypt the stored data. This approach is useful for applications requiring secure storage for sensitive data like login credentials, API keys, or other confidential information.

## Key Features üîë

- AES-GCM encryption for secure data storage.
- Password-based key derivation using PBKDF2 with adjustable iterations.
- Support for serializing and deserializing encrypted data.
- Data integrity validation with SHA-256 checksum.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

### Key Derivation üîë

To securely derive an encryption key from the user-provided password, the library uses PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2). This key derivation process includes:

- **Password**: User-supplied text to generate the encryption key.
- **Salt**: A random byte array to protect against dictionary attacks.
- **Iterations**: A count that determines how many times the key derivation function is applied, increasing security.

This process results in a master key that is used to encrypt and decrypt data within the keychain.

### Data Encryption and Decryption üîê

The `Keychain` class encrypts and decrypts the key-value store (`kvs`) using AES-GCM, a modern encryption algorithm suitable for secure data storage. The encryption process includes:

1. **Encrypting Data**: Converting the key-value store into an encrypted format with AES-GCM.
2. **Initialization Vector (IV)**: A unique, randomly generated IV used for each encryption session.
3. **Decryption**: Decoding the encrypted key-value pairs with the correct master key and IV.

These steps ensure that data remains secure and can only be accessed by users with the correct password.

### Data Dump and Load üóÉÔ∏è

To support backup and restoration, the library offers methods to export (`dump`) and import (`load`) encrypted key-value pairs. Each dump includes:

- **Encrypted Data**: The encrypted key-value store.
- **Salt**: Used in key derivation for data recovery.
- **Checksum**: A SHA-256 hash of the serialized data, ensuring integrity during backup and restoration.

Loading data requires the correct password to derive the master key, allowing for secure decryption of the key-value pairs.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To use this library, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Winstone-Were/secure-password-manager.git
cd secure-password-manager
npm install

```

## Usage üöÄ


```javascript

const { Keychain } = require('./lib.js');

// Initialize a new keychain
const keychain = await Keychain.init('your-password');

// Add credentials
await keychain.set('https://example.com', 'password123');

// Retrieve credentials
const password = await keychain.get('https://example.com');

// Dump keychain for backup
const [contents, checksum] = await keychain.dump();

// Load an existing keychain
const loadedKeychain = await Keychain.load('your-password', contents, checksum);

```

## Testing üß™

This project includes tests written with Mocha. To run the tests:
If mocha is not installed:
```bash
npm install -g mocha

```
To test:
```bash
mocha
```

## Running the Serverüñ•Ô∏è
To run the server, you need to have Node.js installed. Then, you can run the server.
```bash
node server.js
```
This will start the server on port 3000.

## SHORT QUESTIONS ANSWERS 
**1. Preventing the Adversary from Learning Password Lengths:**
 To prevent the adversary from deducing information about password lengths, the implemented password manager pads each password to a fixed, maximum length before encryption (e.g., 64 characters). By ensuring that all encrypted entries appear to have the same length, this approach hides any length-related information about the passwords, making it impossible for an adversary to infer password lengths based on the ciphertext size.

**2. Preventing Swap Attacks:**
 The implemented password manager prevents swap attacks by tying each domain-password pair to a unique HMAC value derived from the domain name. This approach ensures that any attempt to swap entries will result in a mismatch when the domain‚Äôs HMAC is verified against the stored data. Furthermore, a SHA-256 checksum of the entire database is computed during serialization. This checksum is verified upon loading, allowing the system to detect any tampering in case an adversary attempts to rearrange entries. With these defenses, the password manager effectively detects and prevents swap attacks.

**3. Necessity of a Trusted Location for SHA-256 Hash to Defend Against Rollback Attacks:**
While storing the SHA-256 hash in a trusted location beyond the adversary‚Äôs reach strengthens the system‚Äôs defense against rollback attacks, it is not absolutely necessary. Without a trusted storage location, we could implement an alternative mechanism such as version numbers or timestamps for each entry. By verifying these during each load operation, we could detect whether any rollback has occurred. However, storing the hash in a trusted location simplifies the verification process and provides a more straightforward, robust defense against rollback attacks.
